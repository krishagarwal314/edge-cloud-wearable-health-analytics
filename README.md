## Preview

### Clinician dashboard

![Dashboard mockup](results/figures/dashboard_mockup.png)

> **This is a design mockup, not a screenshot** — the frontend is task F-1 and is not built
> yet (the image is stamped accordingly). The ECG trace inside it is genuine output from
> `edge/simulator/generator.py`. Source: [`results/figures/make_mockup.py`](results/figures/make_mockup.py).

### The edge–cloud cascade, running

Everything below is **real output from the code in this repository**, regenerated with
[`results/figures/make_figures.py`](results/figures/make_figures.py).

![Cascade timeline](results/figures/sim_cascade_timeline.png)

Over a simulated 400-window run (≈67 minutes of wear), the edge model scores every
10-second window. Windows below `τ_low` upload a ~430-byte summary; only the escalated ones
upload a waveform. The shaded bands are the ground-truth abnormal episodes — note that the
error spikes land inside them.

![Bandwidth reduction](results/figures/sim_bandwidth.png)

Measured, not estimated: **86.8 % less data on the uplink** than streaming every raw sample,
against a baseline that is itself compressed so the comparison is not rigged. This is what
keeps five devices inside the AWS IoT Core free-tier quota of 250 000 messages/month.

![Synthesised ECG per profile](results/figures/sim_ecg_profiles.png)

The simulator synthesises physiologically-shaped ECG for six profiles, so the whole pipeline
can be built, demoed and load-tested with no wearable hardware and no AWS spend.

> ⚠️ **Honest caveat:** the anomaly scorer behind these figures is the placeholder heuristic
> in `edge/edge_inference/policy.score_window`, **not** the trained TFLite autoencoder
> (task M-6b). These figures demonstrate that the *pipeline* works end to end; they are not
> the model-accuracy results. Final numbers go in [`results/`](results/README.md) once the
> model is trained.

Try it yourself — no AWS account, no hardware, no cost:

```bash
cd edge && pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m simulator.run --device-id demo-001 --profile mixed \
    --dry-run --windows 400 --interval 0 --seed 7
```

## 3. Problem Statement

Consumer wearables (smartwatches, chest straps, pulse oximeters) generate a continuous,
high-frequency stream of physiological data — heart rate, ECG, SpO₂, skin temperature,
accelerometry. In practice this data is **under-used** for three reasons:

1. **Bandwidth and cost.** Streaming raw high-rate signals (e.g. 125 Hz ECG) to the cloud
   for every user, continuously, is expensive and drains device battery. Most of that data
   is clinically uninteresting.
2. **Latency of critical alerts.** A cardiac event detected only after a round trip to a
   remote data centre — or after a batch job runs overnight — is detected too late to be
   useful.
3. **Fragmentation.** Vendor apps silo the data. Clinicians and researchers get summary
   dashboards, not queryable longitudinal records, and cannot plug in their own models.

**The problem we address:** *How do we build a low-cost, scalable health-analytics pipeline
that detects physiological anomalies in near-real-time without shipping every raw sample to
the cloud, while still preserving enough data for longitudinal analysis and model
retraining?*

Our answer is an **edge–cloud split-intelligence architecture**: a lightweight quantised
anomaly detector runs on the wearable gateway and forwards only (a) periodic compact
summaries and (b) full-fidelity windows around suspicious events. The cloud tier — built
entirely from AWS Free Tier serverless components — performs confirmation inference,
persistence, alerting, and visualisation.

---

## 4. Objectives

**Primary objectives**

- **O1** — Design and implement an end-to-end edge-to-cloud telemetry pipeline for wearable
  vital signs using AWS IoT Core, Lambda, and DynamoDB.
- **O2** — Train a lightweight anomaly-detection model (1-D convolutional autoencoder over
  ECG/HR windows), quantise it to TensorFlow Lite (< 500 KB), and run it on the edge device
  / gateway.
- **O3** — Implement a two-stage inference cascade: cheap edge screening + higher-capacity
  cloud confirmation, and quantify the bandwidth saved versus a naive stream-everything
  baseline.
- **O4** — Deploy the entire cloud tier within **AWS Free Tier limits** (target: **₹0 / $0
  monthly bill**), with infrastructure defined as code (CloudFormation/SAM).
- **O5** — Deliver a responsive web dashboard for live vitals, historical trends, and an
  alert timeline, secured with Amazon Cognito.

**Secondary objectives**

- **O6** — Provide an event-driven alerting path (SNS → email/SMS) with < 5 s end-to-end
  latency from anomalous sample to notification.
- **O7** — Benchmark the system: ingestion throughput, end-to-end latency, model accuracy
  (precision/recall/F1), and cost-per-1000-devices projection beyond Free Tier.
- **O8** — Demonstrate elasticity by replaying a synthetic multi-device load and showing
  automatic Lambda concurrency scaling.

[`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Why this architecture

| Design decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Serverless-first (Lambda, not EC2)** | Lambda's *always-free* 1 M requests + 400 000 GB-s per month never expires, unlike the 12-month EC2 allowance. Matches a bursty, event-driven IoT workload. |
| **AWS IoT Core as the front door** | Managed MQTT with per-device X.509 identity, TLS, and a Rules Engine that invokes Lambda directly — no broker to operate. 250 000 messages/month free. |
| **DynamoDB over RDS** | 25 GB storage + 25 WCU/RCU are *always free*. Time-series access pattern (`device#id` partition, `timestamp` sort) is a natural fit; RDS free tier expires after 12 months. |
| **Edge pre-filtering** | Cuts uplink volume by ~95 % (see §7), keeping us inside the IoT Core message quota at realistic sampling rates. |
| **S3 static hosting for the SPA** | No server to run; CloudFront free tier gives 1 TB/month egress. |
